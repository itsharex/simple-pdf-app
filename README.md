# A Simple PDF App

## Overview

This is my first Tauri app and it is a simple PDF Utility GUI tool. The tool is intended for merging PDFs quickly and easily. It is a work in progress and I plan on adding more features and UI changes when I have more time.

I built this for my dad, since he kept asking me to merge his PDFs so he didnt have to pay for Adobe.

Please feel free to contribute, I would really appreciate it.

- Merge multiple PDFs into one document
